The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.
The bit also means binary storage in computing or a binary symbol (data) in digital communications into which a bit, as a unit, of information may be stored or encoded.
The name is a portmanteau of binary digit.
The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, on/off, or +/âˆ’ are also commonly used.
The relation between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program.
It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.
A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a single-dimensional (or multi-dimensional) bit array.
A group of eight bits is called one byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined.
Frequently, half, full, double and quadruple words consist of a number of bytes which is a low power of two.
A string of four bits is a nibble.

In computing and digital communications, the most basic unit of information is called a bit.
It's a binary symbol that can store or encode one unit of information.
The name "bit" comes from combining "binary" and "digit".
A bit can represent one of two values, usually shown as "1" or "0", but other symbols like "yes/no" or "on/off" are also used.
How a bit is physically stored or used is decided by the program or device.
A group of eight bits is called a byte, and a string of four bits is called a nibble.

A "bit" is the smallest piece of information in computers and digital communication.
It's like a switch that can either be "on" or "off," represented by "1" or "0."
Other ways of representing these two values are also used.
A group of eight bits is called a "byte," and a group of four bits is called a "nibble."
Different devices and programs may use different ways of representing these values.
