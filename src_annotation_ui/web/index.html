        <b>Instructions:</b>

        Your task in this evaluation is split into two phases. After reading carefully these guidelines, start the first phase by pressing the <em>Next</em> button.
        Please perform all tasks as quickly and as accurately as possible.
        Estimated time is 2 minutes per one text.
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Task:</b> Answer the questions pertaining the text or reorder the sentences using dragging (one of these tasks is chosen randomly).</li>
            <li><b>Evaluation:</b> Let us know how confident you are in the answers and provide some more details about the questions we asked.</li>
        </ol>

        The <em>Next</em> button will be unlocked only after you answered all questions. There is no way to go back to previously finished segments.

        Use the following guidelines in the evaluation phase (0 - least, 5 - most):
        <ul>
            <li><b>Confidence:</b> 0 - my answers are random, 5 - all my answers are very likely correct.</li>
            <li><b>Text simplicity:</b> 0 - the text was difficult to read and I would be able to mark specific parts which need simplifying, 5 - the text was easy to read and it is not possible to simplify it further.</li>
            <li><b>Grammaticality & Fluency:</b> 0 - the text contains some grammar/fluency/continuity errors, 5 - the text is very grammatical, likely written by a professional human editor.</li>
        </ul>
