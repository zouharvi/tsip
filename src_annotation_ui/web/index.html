        <b>Instructions:</b>

        Your task in this evaluation is split into three phases. After reading carefully these guidelines, start the first phase by pressing the <em>Next</em> button.
        Please perform all tasks as quickly and as accurately as possible.
        Estimated time is 2 minutes per one text.
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Reading:</b> Read the text carefully and press <em>Next</em> only after you finished reading.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehension:</b> Answer the questions based on the text. You can consult the text while answering them.</li>
            <li><b>Evaluation:</b> Let us know how confident you are in the answers and provide some more details about the questions we asked.</li>
        </ol>

        The <em>Next</em> button will be unlocked only after you answered all questions. There is no way to go back to previously finished segments.
        <!-- In all phases, if you are unsure about some part of the text, you can click an underlined part of the text to simplify it. -->

        Use the following guidelines in the evaluation phase (0 - least, 5 - most):
        <ul>
            <li><b>Confidence:</b> 0 - my answers are random, 5 - all my answers are very likely correct.</li>
            <li><b>Answerability:</b> 0 - the text did not help in answering any of the questions, 5 - the text covered directly all the answers.</li>
            <li><b>Necessariness:</b> 0 - the text provided needless details that did not help in understanding the text, 5 - the text was focused on the main points.</li>
            <li><b>Complexity:</b> 0 - the text was difficult to read and I would be able to mark specific parts which need simplifying, 5 - the text was easy to read and it is not possible to simplify it further.</li>
            <li><b>Grammaticality:</b> 0 - the text contains some grammar/fluency/continuity errors, 5 - the text is very grammatical, likely written by a human.</li>
        </ul>
        Only if you are very unsure about an answer, select <em>I don't know</em>.
